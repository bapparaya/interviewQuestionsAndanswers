1)Tell me about yourself

2)What are your roles and responsiblities in your current project

3)In which project you have worked explain it

4)Can we override static methods
==>yes both static method and non static methods can be overloaded and overriden but while calling static methods 
in child we can still call the old method by using class name, inherited method and overidden methods can be called direlctly 
to call non static methods we need to create an object through object we can call

5)reverse string without removing the spaces

6)can u write xpath using contians()
==>xpath is a element locating statergy in salenium, it is derived from XML path launguage, extensible markup language
absolute xpath>>which will traverse from each node of the DOM(document object model)
relative xpath>>which will directly jump into the tag that we specify
 //tagname[contains(@attribute, 'value')]==>//div[contains(@class, 'a4bIc')], //textarea[contains(text(),'xpath')]
 using text method ==>//textarea[text()='xpath']
 
 7)how do u drag and drop in selenium
 ==>by using actions class object we can achive
  by using action class we do below acitvities
  click
  double click
  context click(right click)
  key down and up
  move to element
  drag and drop
  scroll by
  etc..
  
 8)what is BDD
  ==>bdd is framework which concentrate on the behavioural driven development, rather than the code it conentrate the how the application has 
  to behave in real time test cases will be written by plain english using cucumber
 
 9)what is the use of driver in selenium
 ==>driver is the key compenent in selenium wihtout driven we cannot work on the browser it will connect to the browser to do any kind of activity, 
 which can be done in automation without driver it wount be possible
 
 10)what is page factory why we use it
 ==>pagefactory is a built in class in selenium when enver we create an object of  the page class page class construcor will be called and inside constructor 
 pagefactory init elements mehtod will initiate the webobjects in the page
 
 11)what are new features in selenium
 driver.findElementByClassName("className");
 ==>
 driver.findElement(By.className("className"));
 driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
 ==>driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(10));
 
 12)when we use robot class in selenium
 ==>robot class is used to do keyboard and mouse activities and also to file handling, upload and download files
 
 13)what is fulent wait in selenium
 ==>it is also one of the waiting startegy here we will be having polling time, say for example if we specify the time as 10 sec and poilling time as 3 sec for
  every 3 sec it will check if the element is present or not if present then it will continue further else it will again wait if it is not able to find 
  in 10 sec then it will throws exception
  
14)scroll a page program
==>using javascript executor as this is not part of the webpage it is part of the browser

15)how to find the duplicate values in the list
==>add the list values in to set

16)http methods crud operations explain using examples
Operation		HTTP Method		Purpose							status codes
Create			POST			Add a new resource				201 created
Read			GET				Retrieve a resource				200 ok
Update			PUT/PATCH		Modify an existing resource		200ok
Delete			DELETE			Remove a resource				204 no contetn 

17)why do we use kibana if we have postman console to check logs
it provides data visualization, analytics we can create a dashboards to create data view for api logs

18)oauth 2.0/oauth1
OAuth 1.0 uses cryptographic signatures to verify requests, while OAuth 2.0 uses tokens. 

19)different status codes
200,201,204,207,400,401,404,429,500

20)difference between rest and soap
soap supports only XML it is more secure 
Rest supports XML,JSON,HTML  less secure

21)can we use post method to update the resource
yes but not standered practice

22)beren token
A bearer token is a short-lived credential that grants access to a resource to the party in possession of the token. 
Bearer tokens are a common HTTP authentication method and are a core feature of OAuth 2.0
=================
Second round

1)Tell me something about yourself

2)can u explain your project

3)why string is immutable in java
because of security and effeciency reasons string is immutable

4)method over loading and overriding
same name with different param is overload
same signature but different impl is override

5)what is abstruct class in java
abstruct class is used to hide the impamentation and showing the implamentation to the user
abstruct class will be have unimplamneted methods and implamented methods means which will have only signature not the implametation
abstruc class start with the key word abstract and methods also abstruct and it can have non abstruc methods as well
immdiate child class should implamet this

6)what is super keyword in java
super keyword referce to the the immdiate parent class parent class 
super can be used to refer immediate parent class instance variable.
super can be used to invoke immediate parent class method.
super() can be used to invoke immediate parent class constructor.

7)difference between final and finally
final variable,method,class==>we cannot change the variable value,method cannot be overriden, class canot be inherited
try {
    driver.get("https://example.com");
    test.pass("Navigated to example.com");
} catch (Exception e) {
    test.fail("Test failed: " + e.getMessage());
} finally {
    extent.flush(); // Ensures the report is generated
    driver.quit();
}

8)what is contrstuctor
constructor is a sepcial type of methd which is having name same as class name it is used to intialize the object
constructor will be called at the time of object creation, it doesnot return any return type

9)what is access modifier
public all
protected same package and child
default same package not child class
private within the class

10)what is collection
In Java, Collections refer to a framework that provides architecture for storing, managing, and manipulating groups of objects.
collection framework will be used to work with the objects to store and manage and manipulate etc..
which provide interfaces like arraylist, hasset, hashmap etc...
by using we can work with objects and it doesnot have any fixed size tht is one more advantage
if we want to go with list it allows duplicate values and index order will be preserved
if we look into the set it will not allow duplicates and index order wont be there
if we look into hashmap here also it wont allow duplicate values here we store key value pair combo

11)difference between list and set
if we want to go with list it allows duplicate values and index order will be preserved
if we look into the set it will not allow duplicates and index order wont be there

12)WAP to print occurance of element and count of elements from given in the array
usig hasmap it can be done
