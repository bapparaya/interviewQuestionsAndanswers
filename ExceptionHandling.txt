Exception
Exception is an even that causes the program termination where ever the exception happens from there code execution wont happen
 there are two kinds of exceptions in java
 checked exceptions
 unchecked exceptions
 
 checked eceptions are the exceptions complier will recognises it adn it will suggest us to handle the eceptions we can handle this
 by using try catch block or throws declaration
 example: FilenoteFoundException, InterruptedException(thread.sleep),IOEException
 
 checked exceptions are the exceptions which appears during the runtime which we have to identify adn handle it using
 try catch block
 example: NullPOinterException, ArrayOutOfBoundException,NosuchElementFoundException etc..
 
 Handling the exception
 using trycatch block we have to handle the exception
 example
 try{
 sysout(100/0)
 }
 catch(Exception e)
 {
 sysout(e.getmessage())
 }
 
 for one try block multiple catch block are possible and only one finally block can be added
 try bloc will exceute catch block will execute if there are any exception and it will handle then finally block will mandotorily
 execute
 
 usually finally block will be written to close the connection sort of oparation like driver.close or close the file connection if any file connection
 esaablished
 
 for unchecked exception we will use only try catch block
 for checked exceptions we can use both try catch and throws
